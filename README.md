# Tutorial for Angular 2

  Angular2 tutorial is a copy of offical Heroes tutorial.
  It uses webpack-dev-server. And There is no other web container. 
  So we can use the brickyard watch mode to run the code.

  ```bash
  brickyard build tutorial-angular2-plan --dir build-angular2 --watch
  ```

  Then visit http://localhost:8080/

# Tutorial for React

  React tutorial is an app based on the [offical tutorial](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html)([repo](https://github.com/reactjs/react-tutorial)).
  It has an api server. So we can use the brickyard build and run cmd.

  ```bash
  brickyard build tutorial-react-plan --dir build-react --run
  ```

  Then visit http://localhost:8080/

# Tutorial for React Native

  The React Native tutorial is an app based on this [tutorial](http://reactnative.cn/docs/0.42/sample-application-movies.html).
  It uses react-native-web to simulate the native env so that the code can run in browser.

  ```bash
  brickyard build tutorial-react-native-plan --dir build-react-native --watch
  ```

  Then visit http://localhost:8080/

  To run in mobile, we need to [setup the react-native environment](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) and do some manual copy job.
